CompatHelper is a Julia package that helps you keep your `[compat]` entries up-to-date.

Whenever one of your package's dependencies releases a new version, CompatHelper opens a pull request on your repository that modifies your `[compat]` entry to reflect the newly released version.

## Installation

The easiest way to use CompatHelper is to install it as a GitHub Action.

To install CompatHelper as a GitHub Action on your repository:

1. Go to the GitHub page for your repository.


2. Click on the "Actions" tab. (If you don't see the "Actions" tab, follow the instructions [here](#actions-setup).)
3. If you have never set up any GitHub Actions on your repository, you will be brought to a page that says "Get started with GitHub Actions". In the top right-hand corner, click on the button that says "Skip this: Set up a workflow yourself". Then go to step 5.
4. If you have previously set up a GitHub Action on your repository, you will be brought to a page that says "All workflows" and has a list of all of the GitHub Actions workflows on your repository. Click on the "New workflow" button. Then, in the top right-hand corner, click on the button that says "Skip this: Set up a workflow yourself". Then go to step 5.
5. An editor will open with some content pre-populated by GitHub. Delete all of the pre-populated content.
6. Copy the content from the [`.github/workflows/CompatHelper.yml`](.github/workflows/CompatHelper.yml) file in the CompatHelper.jl repository and paste it into the editor.
7. Name the file `CompatHelper.yml`. (The full path to the file should be `.github/workflows/CompatHelper.yml`.)
8. In the top right-hand corner, click on the green "Start commit" button, and then click on the green "Commit new file" button.

CompatHelper is now installed as a GitHub Action on your repository.


## Actions Setup
* Sign up for the beta of GitHub Actions from https://github.com/features/actions 
* Open the specific repository, navigate to the Settings tab, click Actions option, check if the Actions is enabled for this repository.


## Custom pre-commit hooks

CompatHelper supports running a custom function just before commiting changes.
By default, this function updates any `Manifest.toml` files in your repository to reflect new compatibility bounds.
If you want to extend this behaviour, you can pass your own zero-argument function to `CompatHelper.main`, like so:

```yaml
run: julia -e '
  using CompatHelper;
  CompatHelper.main() do;
    CompatHelper.update_environments();
    println("I did it!")
  end;'
```

This snippet uses `;` to specify the ends of lines, because according to YAML, the entire block of Julia code is a single line.
Also to note is that you cannot use `'` inside of your Julia command, since it's used to quote the Julia code.

A full example is available here: https://github.com/tkf/Kaleido.jl/blob/master/.github/workflows/CompatHelper.yml
