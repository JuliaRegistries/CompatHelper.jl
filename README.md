CompatHelper is a Julia package that helps you keep your `[compat]` entries up-to-date.

Whenever one of your package's dependencies releases a new version, CompatHelper opens a pull request on your repository that modifies your `[compat]` entry to reflect the newly released version.

## Installation

The easiest way to use CompatHelper is to install it as a GitHub Action.

To install CompatHelper as a GitHub Action on your repository:

1. Go to the GitHub page for your repository.


2. Click on the "Actions" tab. (If you don't see the "Actions" tab, follow the instructions [here](#actions-setup).)
3. If you have never set up any GitHub Actions on your repository, you will be brought to a page that says "Get started with GitHub Actions". In the top right-hand corner, click on the button that says "Skip this: Set up a workflow yourself". Then go to step 5.
4. If you have previously set up a GitHub Action on your repository, you will be brought to a page that says "All workflows" and has a list of all of the GitHub Actions workflows on your repository. Click on the "New workflow" button. Then, in the top right-hand corner, click on the button that says "Skip this: Set up a workflow yourself". Then go to step 5.
5. An editor will open with some content pre-populated by GitHub. Delete all of the pre-populated content.
6. Copy the content from the [`.github/workflows/CompatHelper.yml`](.github/workflows/CompatHelper.yml) file in the CompatHelper.jl repository and paste it into the editor.
7. Name the file `CompatHelper.yml`. (The full path to the file should be `.github/workflows/CompatHelper.yml`.)
8. In the top right-hand corner, click on the green "Start commit" button, and then click on the green "Commit new file" button.

CompatHelper is now installed as a GitHub Action on your repository.


## Actions Setup
* Sign up for the beta of GitHub Actions from https://github.com/features/actions 
* Open the specific repository, navigate to the Settings tab, click Actions option, check if the Actions is enabled for this repository.


## Updating `Manifest.toml` files after updating compat information

If you check in `Manifest.toml` file(s), the PR created by default CompatHelper setup does not run CI with the latest versions of the dependencies.  In this case, it may be a good idea to run `Pkg.update()` via CompatHelper.  This can be done simply using the following snippet instead `run: julia -e 'using CompatHelper; CompatHelper.main()'`:

```yaml
run: >-
  julia -e '
  using CompatHelper;
  CompatHelper.main() do;
      run(`julia --project=test -e "import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate(); Pkg.update()"`);
      run(`julia --project=docs -e "import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate(); Pkg.update()"`);
  end
  '
```

This setup updates `test/Manifest.toml` and `docs/Manifest.toml` before CompatHelper creates a commit for the pull request.

This snippet uses `>-` to specify a long one-liner command using multi-line code (i.e., the shell does not see the newline characters after `;`).  Note that every line must ends with `;` when using `>-`.  Do not use `'` inside (outer) Julia code since it is used to quote the command line option `-e '...'`.
